Majority of farmers face challenges in selecting suitable crops and managing plant health. To find a solution to this problem I developed a Flask web application to recommend crops, suggest fertilizers, and detect plant diseases by integrating Machine Learning models to analyze soil data for accurate crop recommendations and utilized Deep Learning for plant disease detection. This resulted in a 99.55% accuracy in crop recommendations, significantly improving farming decisions and boosting productivity.
